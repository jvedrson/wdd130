          <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>
              Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the
              nickname long
              ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit
              and fell so
              in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
            </p>
            <p>
              Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly
              sighted. The
              river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the
              campsites and
              provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in
              the United
              States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
              slower, and
              warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim
              tend to
              appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows
            towards the
            mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have
            made this run
            famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and
            boasts
            outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity,
            and great
            whitewater opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness
            and rich
            history that the canyon tells.

          <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>
              This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your
              visit to the
              Grand Canyon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly
              unforgettable
              river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons
              and ancient
              indian ruins accessible only by river.
            </p>
            <p>
              CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically
              rated I - X ( 1
              - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar
              with the
              regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
