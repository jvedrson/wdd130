            <p>
              Classic Mode is the main mode of League of Legends. Here, two teams of five players will enter the well-known Summoner's
              Rift, each team will compete against each other to destroy the opposing team's base. On the Rift map there are 3 lanes
              (Top, Mid and Bot) and a jungle in which you must destroy monsters to obtain gold, experience and buffs that will give
              you an advantage in the game. This mode requires teamwork, strategic thinking and individual skills. All this will lead
              you to victory or defeat.

              Yes, just as you heard a single lane. There will be no options to retreat to the base to restore your champion's health
              nor will you be able to enter the jungle as it will not exist on this map. Champions are selected at random, so your
              level as a player will be tested, resulting in chaotic and unpredictable battles.
