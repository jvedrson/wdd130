    <h4>League of Legends</h4>
    <p>
      League of Legends also known as “LoL” is a popular online multiplayer battle arena game that was developed by Riot
      Games. Its first release was in the year 2009 and since then it has gained a large and dedicated player base around the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game consists of two teams, each made up of five players. Players on each team choose from a variety of characters,
      called champions, with different abilities and roles in the game. The main objective is to destroy the opposing team's
      base (Nexus) while at the same time defending your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In League of Legends, team communication, strategy, individual skills, response times and distractions are important to
      achieve victory. Its sensation, influence and existence has come to cause a great significant impact as an electronic
      sport (eSport). Which has helped esports gain popularity around the world and attract millions of viewers.
    </p>

      attack your opponents from a distance, there is something suitable for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Tactical gameplay: League of Legends is a strategic team game where collaboration and communication are crucial. You
      will have to learn to work together with your team members to destroy the enemy base and achieve victory. The game
      requires tactical thinking, quick decision making and the ability to adapt to different situations. Not only will your
      individual mechanical ability bring you victory, but also maintaining a good tactical game.
    </p>

      modes and maps are added regularly to keep the gaming experience fresh and exciting. There is always something new to
      discover and learn. The gameplay will require perseverance and adaptations to new styles and situations that will give
      you new fun.

    <h4>History Worlds League of Legends</h4>
    <p>      
      The event was first created in 2011 by the game's creators themselves, RIOT Games. The idea of the event was the same as
      today, bringing together the best players in the world to compete against each other, with a prize for the winning team
      of $50,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first event was held at Dreamhack Summer 2011 in Jönköping, Sweden. The final of the first League of Legends World
      Cup pitted the two favorite sides: Europe and North America. Finally, the European team, Fnatic, managed to win the
      first League of Legends World Cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second year is the turning point of the Worlds, where several of the most significant changes in its history
      occurred. The venue was in Los Angeles, United States, and more than five thousand people attended in person and a total
      of seven million viewers streamed. The prize for the winners of the second event was raised to one million dollars. For
      that event, what is known today as the 'Summoner's Cup' was created, which was commissioned by Thomas Lyte, a luxury
      goldsmith in charge of making high-profile sports trophies such as the Guinness Six Nations Rugby Cup or the Rugby
      Trophy the FA Cup of the Premier League.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important milestones in the history of the LoL Worlds occurred that year with the inclusion of Asian
      countries such as South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Since that year, no team outside of Asia has managed to win the rest
      of the LoL World Cups.
