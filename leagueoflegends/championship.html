      <h2>History Worlds League of Legends</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The event was first created in 2011 by the game's creators themselves, RIOT Games. The idea of the event was the same as
          today, bringing together the best players in the world to compete against each other, with a prize for the winning team
          of $50,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          This first event was held at Dreamhack Summer 2011 in Jönköping, Sweden. The final of the first League of Legends World
          Cup pitted the two favorite sides: Europe and North America. Finally, the European team, Fnatic, managed to win the
          first League of Legends World Cup.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second year is the turning point of the Worlds, where several of the most significant changes in its history
          occurred. The venue was in Los Angeles, United States, and more than five thousand people attended in person and a total
          of seven million viewers streamed. The prize for the winners of the second event was raised to one million dollars. For
          that event, what is known today as the 'Summoner's Cup' was created, which was commissioned by Thomas Lyte, a luxury
          goldsmith in charge of making high-profile sports trophies such as the Guinness Six Nations Rugby Cup or the Rugby
          Trophy the FA Cup of the Premier League.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most important milestones in the history of the LoL Worlds occurred that year with the inclusion of Asian
          countries such as South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Since that year, no team outside of Asia has managed to win the rest
          of the LoL World Cups.
