          <p>
            League of Legends also known as “LoL” is a popular online multiplayer battle arena game that was developed by Riot
            Games. Its first release was in the year 2009 and since then it has gained a large and dedicated player base around the
            world.

          <p>
            The game consists of two teams, each made up of five players. Players on each team choose from a variety of characters,
            called champions, with different abilities and roles in the game. The main objective is to destroy the opposing team's
            base (Nexus) while at the same time defending your own.

            In League of Legends, team communication, strategy, individual skills, response times and distractions are important to
            achieve victory. Its sensation, influence and existence has come to cause a great significant impact as an electronic
            sport (eSport). Which has helped esports gain popularity around the world and attract millions of viewers.
