    <h2>Eder</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone, my name is Ederson but you can call me Eder. I'm from Venezuela and I'm 29 years old. This is my
      first time at BYU-Idaho, and I chose to study Software Development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work as a Web Developer (Back-end). I like programming and coding, I like
      watching series, anime, movies, video games and sports. But above all I
      like technology, and that is the reason why I decided to study more about
      this environment. I want to obtain a degree and I consider this to be the
      best place to learn and obtain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to start my studies thanks to my wife who encouraged me to
      improve and obtain a degree for my professional and personal growth. In 2
      months we will be married for 2 years, we are young in this marriage
      thing, but I love spending time with her and listening to her, she always
      encourages me to give my best.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a member for 13 years, and currently serve as a counselor in the bishopric.
    </p>
    <p>
      My native language is Spanish, and English is my second language in
      learning, I hope to improve as much as I can in it, I still have a lot to
      learn but I trust that I can give my best. I am open to your comments and
      help, I hope to be of help to you at some point.
